      <h3>Difficulty in Single Player</h3>
      <p><mark>How can we make a game more challenging?</mark> I’m not
        talking about designing a new game to be hard to win at, I’m talking
        about taking an existing game or prototype and changing things to make
        it more challenging for the player. For now I’m just considering single
        player games to avoid the related question of “how do I make a game more
        difficult for all players”, I just care about making the experience of
        one player more challenging. <mark>There are two main approaches for adding difficulty to a game: HP sliders and
          smarter AI.</mark></p><br>
      <p>I’m using the term “HP sliders” as a catchall term to represent
        all possible variables in a game, not just the health variable. A
        slider is just a term to represent a range of values for the variable,
        like a sound volume bar. <mark>A more difficult game gives the bad guys more health and the player less
          health.</mark>
        Additionally, giving the bad guys more attack, speed, or range will
        translate into them doing more damage to the player. So variable sliders
        for other statistics can still be thought of taking health away from
        the player, which we defined as the difficulty of a game.</p><br>
      <p>Internal stats aren’t the only variables that can be changed.
        The number of enemies can also be changed to affect difficulty. More bad
        guys means more difficulty. Variable changes can also be applied to
        neutral elements of the game to increase difficulty. For instance, less
        ammo or health spawns, smaller reward drops, or even a more dangerous
        layout variants of a room will all increase difficulty.</p><br>
      <p>Often times however, these <mark>variable sliders are seen as cheap tricks to make the game more
          difficult.</mark>
        Players may think that the opponent is no longer playing a fair game.
        And that’s a correct observation, they literally have better stats or
        more troops. Consider Sid Meier's Civilization games, at a certain
        difficulty point the rival nations start to “cheat” and get free bonuses
        to combat, their economies or technological growth while the player
        starts off behind and handicapped. The game is no longer balanced, it’s
        easier for one side (or one player if you’re considering multiplayer
        games) than another. But there’s nothing inherently wrong with that
        design perspective. It’s an easy way to add difficulty to a game that
        might need it, and <mark>single player games are often ok with making the computer unevenly powerful.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p>The alternative to these kinds of “cheap tricks” is <mark>making the enemies more intelligent.</mark>
        Building a smarter AI for the player to play against may be more fair,
        but the costs of development and the actual extra fun a player would
        have may not be worth it. On one hand, the HP sliders simply provide the
        computer with more raw resources to work with. Smarter AI allows the
        computer to perform better with the few resources it already has. An
        artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be a neural network or a complex
        codebase simulating general intelligence. Simply designing a better
        rule or set of rules for the AI to follow is enough: “Before jumping out
        of cover, make sure your gun is loaded”, or “Don’t just run straight
        toward the player when trying to touch them, but zig-zag a little
        randomly to make it harder to predict”. Developing different patterns of
        AI, or introducing a little random chance into movement or decision
        making is an ok replacement for more intelligent AI, up to a certain
        point. Additionally, the computer AI can cheat. Give the AI access to
        restricted information, or knowledge of upcoming rng values. Letting the
        AI cheat and stack the deck a little will make the game more difficult,
        but again, it might not be seen as “fair”.</p><br>

      <p><mark>TL;DR Difficulty in a game comes from two main areas:
          variable sliders and smarter AI. Conceptually think of these two options
          as giving the enemy more resources to work with vs having the enemy use
          those resources more efficiently. Difficulty can also come from non
          enemy parts of the game like loot drops and map layouts. Also, when
          developing an enemy AI for a single player game there’s nothing that
          says the computer can’t cheat.</mark></p><br>
