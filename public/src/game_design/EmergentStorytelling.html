      <h3>Emergent Storytelling</h3>
      <p><mark>What kind of stories do games tell?</mark>
        The relationship between games and story tellings is not a clear
        one. Traditional storytelling mediums (like books, movies, comics, etc.)
        are what most people consider when thinking of the term “storytelling”.
        Putting aside the idea of reader response theory for a minute, these <mark>traditional mediums are static, non
          changing</mark>. The text in a book or the order of scenes in a movie never change.</p><br>
      <p>Games also can tell stories. Some of the famous RPG titles like
        Chrono-trigger or Final Fantasy are famous for their world building,
        relatable characters and rich story. Other games are less focused on
        storytelling and instead focus on letting the player do cool things like
        shooting aliens Halo or jumping off of buildings in Assassin's Creed.
        But a story exists in these games too. </p><br>
      <p>It gets more complicated when considering more open world games
        like Skyrim. Skyrim has a story: “You’re the chosen one. Go get the
        power, then kill the dragon and save the world”. However, this plot is
        interwoven in an open mess of other characters, conflicts, and stories
        that the player can choose to follow or not. <mark>The game provides a context or framework for a story, but
          it’s up to the player to write their own story</mark>.
        Every time someone starts a game of Skyrim, it will be different in
        some small way. The order of events, the characters, the side quests,
        the loot will all be different. <mark>The story itself will be different every time</mark>.</p><br>
      <p>Games like The Sims or Minecraft fully capture this idea. There
        is no story, no defined goal and sometimes no “you win” screen. It’s up
        to the player to discover their own unique story in the game. The
        gameplay of Minecraft is very reminiscent of children playing make
        believe together. There is no one “author” of the adventure, but at the
        end of the day a great story has emerged of punching trees and fighting
        zombies. Other games like Breath of the Wild only offer the name and
        location of the final boss and leave the player on their own. This
        forces players to truly become Link and think for themselves how to
        prepare, or what to do in this fantastical story. <mark>The player is the main author of the story, the game
          designer is simply creating the boundaries and providing some inspiration</mark>.</p><br>
      <p>So, we can see these two styles of storytelling. On one hand,
        the author writes a story for others to follow exactly (books, movies,
        linear plot games, etc.), but on the other hand it’s the players
        themselves who are writing the story. I will call this first style of
        story a “<mark>traditional story</mark>” and this second story an “<mark>emergent story</mark>”
        because it’s a story that comes about indirectly from interacting with
        the system. Notice I didn’t say that an emergent story is unexpected or
        unplanned, some games encourage certain stories to emerge. For example,
        with Skyrim it is encouraged that the player becomes the “hero”, but not
        required. They can develop your own story and role play as a thief, or
        get a house and settle down with a family, or simply collect every book
        in the world into a giant library. </p><br>
      <p>Designing a game that promotes emergent storytelling is not
        easy because, by definition, the designer must give up control of the
        story to the player. There are tricks, I think Pokemon and Legend of
        Zelda games are good examples, and I will discuss some of these later.</p><br>
      <p>But as you develop or play games in the future, pay attention
        to what kind of traditional story is being told. But once you get bored
        of that, try and see if you can make your own story emerge from the
        characters, settings and conflicts already present in the game. Writing
        your own emergent stories from other games is the best way to learn what
        kind of elements are required to inspire your own players.</p><br>
      <p><mark>TL;DR Games tell stories. In general, the stories that
          the game designer writes are called traditional stories while the stores
          that the players write (or discover) themselves are emergent stories.
          Emergent stories are unique to games insomuch that player choice can
          influence the story directly. A game designer should be aware of this
          and perhaps think of games as helping to guide the player’s creativity
          and imagination as they play.</mark></p><br>
