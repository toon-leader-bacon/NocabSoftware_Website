      <h3>Complexity, Difficulty and Challenge in Single Player Games</h3>
      <p>Difficulty in games we <a href="https://nocabsoftware.com/src/game_design/Difficulty.html">previously</a>
        defined as variable sliders or smarter AI. In summary, to make the game
        more of a challenge either provide the computer player with more
        resources (variable sliders) or use the resources more effectively
        (smarter AI).</p><br>
      <p>However, I want to introduce the idea of “complexity” in the context of game challenge.</p><br>

      <p><mark>Complexity is the number of mechanics, or underlying numbers needed to understand the game.</mark>
        In simple terms, complex games are hard to learn. For example Dwarf
        Fortress, most Paradox games, Warhammer 40k are all complex games
        because they have so many moving interconnected parts. Grand Strategy
        games, or simulation games like the Sims are usually very complex. Non
        complex games are like Tetris, or checkers, or some classic board games
        like Scrabble or Monopoly. Simple games usually only have a few
        affordances or mechanics that the player can do. In Tetris, the blocks
        fall and you move and rotate them. That’s it. The challenge of the game
        comes from “hp sliders” like speed of the blocks or type of blocks that
        fall. But every block follows the same rules. In checkers every piece
        moves in the same way (except the king pieces after getting to the other
        end of the board). Chess on the other hand, a more complex board game,
        has several different pieces each with their own set of movement rules. <mark>In complex games the challenge
          comes primarily from trying to understand what is going on.</mark></p><br>

      <p>So, what does adding complexity do to the game experience?
        Specifically, does complexity help us answer our guiding question of
        “How can we make a game more challenging?”</p><br>

      <p>Think of complexity like a set of tools. <mark>Complex games have lots of specific, sophisticated and maybe
          dangerous tools.</mark>
        While new players are intimidated by the tool set and don’t know what
        to do with it all, experienced players can take the tools and build a
        “better” game experience (In this case better means easier wins for the
        player). So complexity does impact the challenge of the game. But it’s a
        different impact depending on how experienced the player is. <mark>More
          complexity for an experienced player will make the game easier because
          they have more tools to use. While less complexity will make a game
          easier for new players.</mark></p><br>

      <p>So, complexity and difficulty both affect the challenge of a game.
        Now, I haven’t introduced the term challenge, but it’s hard to define
        the difference between challenge and difficulty without an understanding
        of complexity. <mark>Challenge is the overall effort needed to win a game, including complexity and
          difficulty.</mark></p><br>

      <p>A few examples, let’s consider chess. To make a game less complex we
        remove some mechanics or underlying statistics of the game.To make chess
        less complex let's replace the knight with another castle. The knight
        piece is the only piece that can hop over other pieces, and it moves in a
        unique L shape. This makes it a relatively complex piece, compared to
        the castle which only moves in straight lines and can’t hop. Removing
        the knight completely also removes the mechanic of hopping pieces
        because no other piece has that ability. What does this change do to the
        challenge of the game? Well, for more experienced players you’re
        removing a key offensive piece. A lot of strategies are now completely
        invalid without the knight, and while I’m not a chess expert myself, for
        the sake of example I’ll just claim that removing the piece from the
        game would make it relatively more difficult for a player that’s used to
        playing with the knight. But for in-experienced players they no longer
        have to worry about a piece jumping over their carefully set up
        defences.</p><br>

      <p>Let’s go back to our question of “How can we make a game more challenging?”. Now we have a few tools to answer
        this</p><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Up the difficulty of the game
          <ul>
            <li> Increase the enemy HP sliders
            </li>
            <li> Increase the enemy artificial intelligence
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mess with the complexity of the game
          <ul>
            <li> If you’re making it harder for new players add complexity
            </li>
            <li> If you’re making it harder for experienced players remove complexity
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol><br>


      <p>The strategy you should use for your game depends on the game and is
        entirely up to the designer to figure out what strategy is best.</p><br>
