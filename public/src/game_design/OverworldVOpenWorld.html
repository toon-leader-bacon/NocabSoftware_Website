      <h3>Overworld vs Open World</h3>
      <p>An important thing to consider early on in the design process
        of a new game is the setting, or the world that the game takes place in.
        Traditional storytelling mediums, like books or movies, only contain
        the character’s immediate surrounds, while more mundane areas are left
        out like transitions between scenes. However, games can allow for a
        player to explore for themselves and sometimes emphasise parts of the
        world that traditional mediums leave out. I want to <mark>consider these
          two styles of setting development: On the one hand the setting is
          striped down to exist only where there is important content, and on the
          other hand the story is embedded into a larger world.</mark> With that in mind, let’s set some definitions.
      </p><br><br>
      <p><mark>Overworld: A type of setting that contains pockets of interesting content that the player is teleported
          to.</mark>
        The transitions between scenes is sudden so as to trim out unimportant
        areas or down time. The term overworld is sometimes taken literally and
        provides the player with a map of points of interest that a player can
        warp to, and other times a “hubworld” is used where the player has
        access to all the other levels of the game. Some example overworld games
        include Ratchet and Clank, Mairo (both older 2D and newer 3D games),
        and first person shooter games like Halo or Doom. In general, games that
        have discrete levels often times are overworld style games.</p><br>
      <p><mark>Open World: A type of setting that is continuous and has areas of content embedded into a larger world
          map.</mark>
        Often times a player can walk continuously from one end of the world to
        the other. Usually an open world doesn't “rail-road” the player and
        provides them with meaningful crossroads. Some examples of open world
        games include Runescape, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild or Hollow
        Knight.</p><br><br>
      <p>Why would a designer pick one of these settings over the other? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?
      </p><br>
      <p>First consider the <mark>Overworld</mark> style of games.</p>
      <p>By definition, an overworld has (mostly) isolated pockets of
        content. These pockets are where all the stuff happens. Using Ratchet
        and Clank as an example, the player flies to a new planet and finds a
        self contained experience complete with enemies, weapons, buildings,
        platforms, boxes and loot. Generating engaging content between levels is
        a lot of effort, and may not contribute much to the game. So cutting it
        out saves development time and resources. This allows the designer to
        focus on the “fun” parts of the game and <mark>condenses game content into a series of compelling levels.</mark>
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, who wants to watch their character walk along a
        boring old road anyways? Overworld settings take the player straight to
        the action and can keep the down-time low. So if your game has pushes
        fast paced action (like Doom) or focuses on some other concentrated
        affordance (like puzzle games), then an overworld style of game can help
        ensure that the content is not diluted. </p>
      <p>A neutral aspect of overworld style games is that player
        mobility often times becomes trivial. Allowing a player to teleport to
        any previous level or section of the game is not good or bad, but simply
        something to keep in mind while designing. What incentive is there for a
        player to progress through the game if they can just go back to the
        first level and dominate?</p>
      <p>One possible negative of overworld style games is that the
        sudden teleportation into a new area takes the player out of their
        suspension of disbelief. Some games however actually encourage this
        meta-game behavior and actively pull the player out of the story. In the
        3D Mario games each area has a certain number of stars to collect, so
        the player must replay the same area to try and get more stars. It
        doesn't entirely make sense in the story why the player is going back to
        the same place, which breaks immersion. But here, <mark>the game is the focus, not the story.</mark>
        An overworld map is just that: a map. It lends itself to meta-game
        planning, or thinking about the game like a game, not an unfolding
        story.</p><br><br>
      <p>Now consider <mark>Open World</mark> games.</p>
      <p>Open world games, by definition, need content to fill in the
        space between points of interest. So while overworld games focus on
        concentrating the game in pockets, open world games often focus on this
        inbetween space. Games like Pokemon or other RPGs are a great example
        where the travel between gyms (or points of interest) is filled with new
        monsters, environments, characters, side quests, etc. This extra game
        content takes development time to produce but if designed correctly the
        ‘travel between story points’ itself may become the gameplay.</p>
      <p>Open world games tend to emphasize exploration, experimentation and individual choice. This <mark>enables the
          player to project themselves into the character</mark>
        they control and effectively become the character. A lot of modern open
        world games only allow the player to control a single character which
        also reinforces the idea that the player themselves is an entity in the
        game world, as opposed to the idea that the player is watching a story
        about other characters.</p>
      <p>Open world settings tend to <mark>take the storytelling responsibility away from the designer and hand it to
          the player</mark>
        to allow them to make their own story. Because open world games have
        “meaningful crossroads”, the designer can’t know what the player will
        do. For example in Skyrim, will the player become a wizard, archer,
        swordsmen? Will they follow the main quest to save the world, or follow a
        side quest and become royalty of a small village? Open world games
        naturally lend themselves to <a
          href="https://nocabsoftware.com/src/game_design/EmergentStorytelling.html">emergent storytelling</a>.
        In short, open world games enable players to make subtle, spur of the
        moment decisions that can have impacts on what the player is doing for
        the next 10 minutes, or next 10 hours of the game.</p>
      <p>On the negative side, open world games sometimes require a lot
        of in game travel time. Open world games live and die by their ability
        to design interesting roads. Running through old content, backtracking,
        or the dreaded “fetch quests” can quickly get boring. So <mark>designing roads or landscapes that are compelling
          for a player is a top priority, but not an easy task.</mark></p><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>These are the general trends of overworld and open world settings. <mark>It’s possible to mix the two.</mark>
        Many traditional turn based RPG games like Chrono Trigger or Final
        Fantasy use a mix of overworld maps with embedded sub-regions of open
        world settings. Pokemon is an open world game that is very linear in
        story and map progression. Finding the right mix of open and overworld
        for your game is a challenge and requires lots of play testing,
        planning, and thought. It all depends on what your trying to achieve. <mark>In
          summary, overworld maps have pockets of well made content while open
          world maps enable for player agency and emergent storytelling.</mark>
        Once you figure out what your game is about, then you can use the right
        tool to achieve it. One of those tools is the map and setting of the
        game.</p>
