      <h3>Particle Filters</h3>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Radar Background and Problem Motivation</h3>
      <p>Radar surveillance has proven to be an extremely effective way of detecting targets, be it airplanes, drones,
        ships or even satellites. Active radar is the process of generating an electromagnetic signal, sending it out
        into
        the environment, then listening for the echo as the signal bounces off a potential target. Passive radars in
        contrast do not directly generate their own signal, and instead are reliant on signals generated by other
        emitters, typically broadcast towers for AM or FM radio, television, or other sources. Often, this external
        source
        is called an “illuminator of opportunity”. In this passive radar regime, the illuminator of opportunities signal
        is typically broadcast uniformly in all directions. The passive receiver will receive the “direct path” signal,
        then after a delay, the “bounce path” signal which is the echo of the original signal bouncing off elements in
        the
        environment. </p>
      <p><mark>A typical passive-multistatic-radar system will involve multiple passive receivers</mark> which will
        allow for triangulation and highly precise target finding <mark>while a single receiver typically can only
          provide
          a bearing-to-target</mark>. However, <mark>it may be possible to produce better results if there are multiple
          illuminators</mark> of opportunity. </p>

      <h3>Prior Work/ Data Source</h3>

      <p>The library that I'm using to generate the radar data that will be fed into the particle filter produces
        'likelihood surfaces', where the value at each point answers the question <mark>“What is the likelihood that the
          received signal originated at this position?”</mark>
        </mark>. An example of this surface is shown below.</p>
      <p><mark>This library was built by Ahsen Uppal</mark>, a PhD candidate at George Washington University as part of
        his work with
        the Graph Lab under Dr. Huang. Additionally the particle filter is built using some external python libraries,
        most notably NumPy. The full list of external libraries for both the physics simulator, and the particle filter
        can be found in the requirements.txt file as part of the github repo. </p>

      <p>Both the physics simulator, and the particle filter can be run on a modern laptop, I'm using a 2023 Macbook Pro
        with an Apple Silicone cpu.</p>

      <h3>Particle Filters</h3>
      <p>Building off of prior work which created a 2D radar physics simulation library, I've built a particle filter to
        automatically detect a reflective target, and track it as it moves through the environment. <mark>A particle
          filter is</mark> a natural choice for solving the target detection and tracking problem, because it is
        somewhat
        <mark>resilient to clutter, and produces a family of possible solutions</mark> instead of a single one. Each of
        these possible solutions, or particles, also has a confidence measure represented by the weights of each
        particle.
        One challenge of particle filters is they require time series of data, but for the radar detection problem this
        is
        not an issue as radar receivers produce time series measurements.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>There are two different scenarios that I ran for this project, the first involves a <mark>stationary
          target, and</mark> the second features <mark>a target with constant velocity</mark>. Everything else in
        the scene will be the same, such as the 6 illuminators (marked with orange dots), the single receiver (a
        green dot at (0, 0) ), even the random number generator seed for the clutter is the same. The only
        difference is the position of the target at different time steps. Both scenarios are run for <mark>100
          simulated seconds</mark>, but the target does not become active until the 10th second. These first 10
        seconds are used by the physics engine to calibrate the likelihood surfaces to partly mitigate the loud
        background signals given off by the powerful illuminators.</p>

      <p>These two scenarios are further broken down into a <mark>likelihood example, and a probability
          example</mark>. The underlying physics engine only produces likelihood surfaces, not probabilities. A
        likelihood value still works for the particle filter, but I wanted to compare if a probability estimate
        would perform noticeably better or worse. There are several options to estimate a probability surface
        given a likelihood surface. I could normalize the likelihood values at each timestamp to sum to 1, I
        could find the maximum likelihood value during the entire 100 second simulation and use that to
        normalize all the time steps. Per the advice of Ahsen Uppal, I decided to follow a more complicated
        policy. <mark>I ran the same scenario several times, but modified every physical parameter in the
          simulation engine by a small gaussian each time, averaged all the likelihood surfaces produced, then
          normalized each surface to sum to 1</mark>. The intuition here is that, in the real world, we will only
        know the position of the illuminators and receivers with some small error. Additionally, the timing of
        the received signal has some error, and the calibration metrics other parameters related to the physics
        engine will never be perfectly exact. By running the same scenario multiple times, but modifying these
        underlying parameters within an error tolerance, we can estimate the probability surfaces. </p>

      <p>One concession here is that <mark>the clutter is exactly the same across all these scenarios</mark>.
        I didn't have an easy way to 'similar but slightly different clutter' across different simulations. I
        only had a random number seed to adjust which would cause the clutter to be wildly different between the
        runs.</p>

      <p>The resulting video of each of these 4 scenarios are shown below.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I notice a few things in these videos. First, the <mark>particles tend to drift towards the
            edge</mark> of simulated space. I believe this is because the cone of high likelihood is much wider
          further away than it is closer to the receiver. So children of the particles that are in the wide
          region (further away) are more likely to stay in the high likelihood area than those that are closer
          to the receiver. Surprisingly, the particle filter which operates on the 'likelihood' surfaces seems
          to be somewhat more resilient to this particle drift issue. This can be seen if you compare 'Moving
          Target w/ Likelihood' and 'Moving Target w/ Probability' videos starting at the 10 seconds.</p>

        <p>However, this is mitigated by a second observation, that <mark>a particle's velocities tend to
            point directly in towards or away from the receiver</mark>. This is most noticeable in the Static
          Probability example starting at the 10 second mark. Again, this velocity will help the particle
          survive the filter longer as it remains inside the high likelihood area much longer than a particle
          whose velocity is orthogonal to the receiver-target line.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>

        <p>I selected three key metrics in order to empirically evaluate the particle filter on this scenario: The
          average distance between all the particles and the target, the single best distance to the target from a
          single particle, and the average bearing-to-target error of all particles. </p>
        <p>In all three metrics, lower is better.</p>

        <p>I've captured the relevant data from the scenarios and plotted the results per model, per timestamp. </p>

        <div class="image-gallery" style="width: 750px; margin: 0 -250px;">

          </figure>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>My first observation is that <mark>both of the linear moving models perform poorly in the “average
            distance” and “best distance” metrics</mark>. Inspecting the videos above, this poor performance can
          be attributed to the drift error mentioned earlier, where the particles tend to <mark>drift to the
            extreme edge</mark> of the simulated space. This manifests as a flat plateau at the distance=3000 line
          in the Single Best Distance to Target graph. Then the target naturally drifts towards the right edge
          so the distance starts to come down. </p>

        <p>My next observation is that the <mark>Likelihood Model (blue line) does consistently better than
            the Probability Model (orange line)</mark>. This is good news, because creating a probability surface
          is much more computationally expensive than creating a likelihood surface. </p>

        <p>Finally, the average bearing-to-target error is about +/- 10 degrees for all 4 of the models, although each
          model does spike above the line temporarily, possibly due to a series of unlucky clutter measurements.</p>

        <p>Drilling down on this bearing-to-target metric a little more, if we compute the average bearing-to-target for
          the entire model from timesteps 20 through 99 (so as to exclude the particle filter initialization steps) we
          get the following average results for each model:</p>

        <p>Moving Target w/ Likelihood Surface: 9.72 deg</p>
        <p>Moving Target w/ Probability Surface: 10.87 deg</p>
        <p>Static Target w/ Likelihood Surface: 8.46 deg</p>
        <p>Static Target w/ Probability Surface: 10.11 deg</p>

        <p>I've done some prior work on this target localization problem, so I'll provide past results to
          contextualize these numbers. </p>
        <p>If I simply took the <mark>average location of all high likelihood points</mark> (a subset of the
          red points in the surface), the average <mark>bearing-to-target error will be about +/- 13.2
            degrees</mark> in the cluttered scenario. I've also trained a <mark>small convolutional neural
            network</mark> to attempt to solve this problem, and in the cluttered scenario it produced and
          <mark>abysmal +/- 45 degrees bearing-to-target error</mark> in the cluttered scenario.
        </p>

        <p>So in conclusion, <mark>the particle filter does provide an improvement on the state of the art for
            identifying the bearing-to-target in a mono-receiver, multistatic, passive radar regime</mark>.</p>
