      <h3>Precise Environmental Recognition and Continuous Habitat-monitoring (PERCH)</h3>

      <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
      <p>code found here: <a

      <p>Using two off-the-shelf models from Huggingface, I built a pipeline
        that counted and classified the types of birds that visited my feeder in a
        12 hour period. This demonstrates that, while these models are generally
        robust with real world data, <mark>the more a priori knowledge a developer has</mark>
        about the domain space to allow them to filter, modify, combine or discard
        results, <mark>the better</mark>.</p><br>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I recently installed a bird feeder on my apartment's porch. I am not a bird person, I've only learned how to
        identify a few birds for the Boyscouts years ago, and even that was only the birds local to the other side of
        the country. I installed the bird feeder, not for myself, but for my cat. She loves to watch the birds, and I'm
        hoping that it provides her a little entertainment and exercise while I'm away from the house. But because I'm
        away from the house, it's hard to determine if the bird feeder plan has been successful. I could tell something
        was showing up and eating the seeds, but I wanted to know more. </p>

      <p>So I've set up an automated camera system to <mark>take a picture of the bird feeder once every 30 seconds for
          24
          hours.</mark> I wanted to determine:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>How many birds visit the feeder in 24 hours</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What types of birds visited</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are there any patterns in how/ when they visit?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>I collected all these images on Oct 12, 2024 from 9:14am until Oct 13th 9:14am. Some sample images are shown
        below:</p>

      <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-00013.jpg">

        </figure>
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-00214.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Sunny Picture</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="item">

          <figcaption class="caption">Picture with Birds</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-01211.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Nighttime Picture</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div> <br>

      <p>Before I get into discussion about the pipeline and the particulars of the algorithms and models used, I want
        to consider these pictures first. A few issues immediately jump out to me. Firstly, <mark>the night time images
          are
          effectively unusable</mark> because of how dark they are. I did not set up any consistent minimum lighting,
        and this
        also may cause problems with some of the day time pictures. For example, in the middle two images, notice how
        the railings of my porch cast dark shadowed lines across the white floor. This may act as a bit of camouflage
        for the birds, confusing or distracting the models that I use. And finally, there is some glare from the sliding
        door that separates the camera from the outside. This is most clearly visible in the first and third pictures as
        white horizontal streaks under and to the right of the bird feeder itself. </p>

      <p>The only one of these issues that I will address is the dark images, and will manually remove them from the
        pool of images. This left me <mark>1,460 images for analysis</mark>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark>For the glare and poor lighting, I intentionally left those issues un-addressed as a way for me to
          evaluate how
          effective the publicly available computer vision models are with imperfect 'real world' data.</mark>
      </p>
      <br>


      <h3>The Pipeline</h3>

      <p>Using a series of models available on Huggingface, I built a small image processing and detection pipeline for
        my personal images. First, using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50">“DETR (End-to-End
          Object Detection) model with ResNet-50 backbone” from
          Facebook (https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50)</a> I generated bounding boxes for each object in
        the scene. Each box included a label and a confidence score.
      </p>
      <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/FullImage_AllBoxes.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">All detected objects boxed</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div> <br>

      <p>I filtered out all low confidence detections, and all detections that were not in the class label “bird”
        leaving only "high" confidence boxes for birds. </p>
      <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/FullImage_BirdBoxes_gimp.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Only detected "high confidence" and only "birds"</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div> <br>
      <p>While the filters I added are somewhat effective, they're not perfect. Notice that one of the flowers is still
        marked as a 'bird', one bird is boxed twice, and one bird is missed entirely. But the system was good enough to
        detect even partial tails of birds.
      </p>

      <p>Then, I cut out each box to get a fairly clean picture of just the bird.
      </p>
      <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-00049_6.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Sparrow</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-00049_10.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Rock Dove (Pigeon)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/PERCH/snapshot-00049_21.jpg">
          <figcaption class="caption">Blurry Sparrow</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div> <br>

      <p>I didn't use the exact bounding box, instead I added some buffer on every edge of the picture. My intention was
        to <mark>keep the target centered in the picture, but also provide some context around the potential
          bird</mark>. Notice, that
        each cropped picture has a different dimension, and some are quite blurry.
      </p>

      <p>Taking each of these cropped images, I then passed them into a specially trained bird species classifier. I
        tried three different models, but the one that seemed to work the best was <a
          href="https://huggingface.co/gungbgs/bird_species_classifier">one developed by Agung Bagus
          (username: gungbgs)
          https://huggingface.co/gungbgs/bird_species_classifier</a>
      </p>

      <p><mark>This classification model produced a set of 5 predicted labels</mark> and the confidence level for each
        detected "bird" box.
        Each of the three sample crops' predictions are shown below:

      <p>While the results of the first two seem reasonable, the last one presents some issues. I know a priori that
        this is a type of sparrow, but the image cas captured mid hop causing it to be blurry and appear to have extra
        long legs. While the predicted labels are reasonable, it is still wrong. </p>

      <p>I've included a picture of a Snowy Plover, Red Know and Asian Crested Ibis for comparison:

      <p><mark>I manually looked through all the bird pictures and identified only four different species of
          birds</mark> that visited:
      </p>
      <p>Pigeons, Sparrows, a dove, and a male and female cardinal. </p>
      <br>
      <p>With this knowledge, I was able to add another filter on the species classification. If one of the 5 provided
        predictions is for one of these 4 species, then that will be the predicted label for the cropped image.
        <mark>Otherwise, simply “Unknown Bird” is the predicted label</mark>.
      </p>

      <pr>
        So, unfortunately for our eager long-legged bird friend, they will be considered unknown.

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>After running the above pipeline on all the images collected, here are the results:</p>
      <div class="" style="white-space: pre-wrap;font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">
        {
        'HOUSE SPARROW': 1238,
        'unknown': 838,
        'CHIPPING SPARROW': 256,
        'ROCK DOVE': 194,
        'FRILL BACK PIGEON': 140,
        'BLACK-THROATED SPARROW': 120,
        'JACOBIN PIGEON': 125,
        'NORTHERN CARDINAL': 80,
        'ZEBRA DOVE': 72,
        'MOURNING DOVE': 42,
        'GREEN WINGED DOVE': 25,
        'JAVA SPARROW': 2
        }
      </div>
      <p>As much as I wish I had this level of diversity of birds coming to my
        porch on an average day, I believe there is a lot of misclassification
        happening. A more accurate mapping may be produced if we <mark>merged all the 'sparrows' and 'pigeons' together
          into their respective groupings</mark>. While I'm not a bird expert and I can't determine which
        of the sparrow classes are truly present, using the most common 'House
        Sparrow” seems reasonable. Similarly, using the class “Rock Dove” for all
        the pigeons (despite the name, the Rock Dove is what you probably imagine
        when you imagine a pigeon). With a little amateur ornithology, I believe
        that the three remaining Zebra, Mourning and Green Winged Doves should
        actually be grouped together as 'Mourning Dove'. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The only bird that I believe that the system got correct, or 'Unidentified', is the Northern Cardinal thanks to
        its distinctive coloring. </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Taking this a priori information into account, the new results are as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="" style="white-space: pre-wrap;font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">
        {
        'HOUSE SPARROW': 1616,
        'unknown': 838,
        'ROCK DOVE': 459,
        'NORTHERN CARDINAL': 80,
        'MOURNING DOVE': 139,
        }
      </div>

      <h3>Answering the Initial Questions</h3>
      <p>Armed with these results, we can return to the original questions at the top of this post:
      </p>
      <h4>1: How many birds visit the feeder in 24 hours</h4>
      <p>Overall, the system identified about <mark>3,132 birds</mark>. These are not unique birds, as some the same
        bird is likely
        present in multiple pictures. This, I believe, is <mark>a sizable undercount</mark> of the true number of birds.
        While the
        system did sometimes double count draw multiple identification boxes around the same bird (and therefore
        inflating the total bird count), or identify a flower as a bird, it also would miss birds. My camera setup
        also was <mark>not able to capture the full range of my porch</mark> thereby excluding many birds that came by
        to perch just out of frame. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>2: What types of birds visited</h4>
      <p>The system was least effective at answering this question. Initially, the system would claim that dozens of
        different bird species were visiting. However, this was not true in reality. <mark>I was required to step in and
          add
          more filters, and make reasonable assumptions about the types of birds that visited</mark> (sparrows, doves,
        cardinals,
        pigeons). <mark>I did this with the understanding that many popular classification algorithms are graded on
          their
          rank-5 accuracy.</mark>
      </p>
      <p>And even then, there were a claimed 11 different species of birds visiting. I, again, stepped in and narrowed
        that down to only 4 distinct species.
      </p>
      <p>Of all 3,132 birds, <mark>over 25% of them were labeled as 'unknown'</mark>, which is not an amazing statistic,
        but also not
        terrible. With hundreds of possible classes of birds, and the issues that come with using real world data, a 75%
        correctness rate is quite remarkable.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>3: Are there any patterns in how/ when they visit? </h4>
      <p>The 1,460 daytime pictures I have represented 43800 seconds, or just over 12 hours observations. A naive
        average would say there are about 2 birds per picture. However, many pictures did not contain any birds at all.
        I modified the code to also mark which frames contained a bird at all, and <mark>only 624 pictures included a
          bird</mark>, or
        less than 50%. Using this, we find that if a bird is present, there will be about 5 birds present. Or another
        way to say this, <mark>birds tend to flock to the bird feeder together at the same time</mark>.</p>
      <p>Initially, I set up the bird feeder for my cat to find entertainment while I was away. I found that the birds
        do in fact show up, being <mark>present for 5.2 hours out of 12</mark>. </p>
      <p>So the birds do come by, the next question is: Does
        my cat notice or enjoy them? </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>That question will have to be left for a future project.</p>
