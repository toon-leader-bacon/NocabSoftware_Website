      <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
      <p>
        Grad Cam is a technique that allows a user to interrogate an image
        classification model and ask “what pixels are most relevant when making
        a classification decision?”. This technique is an effective AI
        explainability tool, so I wanted to apply it to embedding models and ask
        a similar question <mark>“what pixels are most semantically
          meaningful”</mark>. Further, I wanted to apply this technique to
        <mark>video, where prior frames may help influence or contextualize the
          current frames</mark>.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Grad Cam</h3>

      <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391">Grad Cam by Selvaraju et al.</a> published in 2019, is a paper which
        describes a technique to produce an image mask showing what regions of an input image are relevant for a given
        loss. From the abstract of the paper:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391">
        Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into
        the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image
        for predicting the concept.
      </blockquote>

      <p>An example of a Grad CAM image is below, which shows a picture of a bull dog, passed through ResNet40, with the
        class label of “bull dog”.</p>
      <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/nocab_cam.jpg" style="width:80%;height:80%;"
        alt="A bull dog with some parts of it highlighted red">

      <p>To a human, it seems like the model has done a pretty good job. The eyes, ears, neck, and part of the body of
        the dog were highlighted as important. </p>

      <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam">this</a> library by github user <a
          href="https://github.com/jacobgil">jacobgil</a> as a template, I decided to build my own Grad Cam tool. To
        simplify, generating a Grad Cam style visualization requires passing an image through a neural network,
        capturing the neuron activations of the last convolutional layer, then capturing the same neuron’s loss gradient
        during a back propagation step. The convolutional layer will naturally have a width and height (it hasn’t been
        linearized yet), so these two saved matrices can be elementwise multiplied with each other. The resulting 2D
        matrix of values is normalized, and scaled to match the original picture, and overlaid.</p>

      <p>This results in an image where pixels that were highly active in the forward pass, and were positively
        reinforced in the backward pass are highlighted in red, while all other pixels are suppressed in blue.</p>

      <h3>Grad Cam for Embedding</h3>
      <p>The original paper applies Grad Cam to classification models. This means, during back propagation, a well
        defined loss can be computed and back propagated through the model to capture the gradients. This will allow for
        the gradients captured to be relevant to the specific class that was back propagated. </p>
      <p>Jacobgil has a good example of this, which demonstrates the same image being passed in (resulting in the same
        neuron activations during the forward pass), but different classes are used during the loss calculation and
        backward propagation, resulting in two totally different Grad Cam visualizations. </p>
      <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/dog.jpg" alt="A picture of a cat and dog, but the dog is highlighted red">
      <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/cat.jpg" alt="A picture of a cat and dog, but the cat is highlighted red">

      <p>The above two examples show the Grad Cam answering the question “What pixels are most helpful for the label
        Dog” and “What pixels are most helpful for the label Cat”.</p>

      <p>However, I want to apply Grad Cam to an embedding model, which does not have a clear label for a given frame.
        In other words, I want to answer the question “What pixels are most semantically meaningful”. So while building
        the Grad Cam for an embedding model was relatively easy, defining a loss function was not. </p>

      <h3>Defining a Loss Function: Text Labels</h3>
      <p>I decided to use CLIP models/ embeddings for this project for two reasons:</p>
      <p>CLIP models are powerful, widely used, and there are several publicly available foundation models built by
        institutions with lots of resources</p>
      <p>CLIP models also allow text to be embedded into the same space as image embeddings. </p>

      <p>The second bullet point is useful, because it allows a way for us to define a loss function which will
        highlight arbitrary items in a scene. For example, consider this capture of a live stream of a bird feeder
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIqUka8BOS8]</p>

      <p>Every 3 frames are embedded into CLIP Space, and compared to the CLIP embedding of the text “birds”. </p>
      [Animated_3.gif]
      <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_animated_3.jpg"
        alt="Bird feeder cam with certain parts related to the term 'birds' highlighted red">

      <p>The highlighted pixels are those that most strongly support the image is “birds”. Notice, the model I’m using
        seems to really attend to the suet feeder box in the center and tends to ignore sparrows. But when a bluebird
        and a cardinal land in the open feeder box, they tends to be the most relevant section of the image. </p>

      <p>Here is another for multiple scenes of Tokyo at night highlight the label “people”</p>
      <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_text_people_animated.gif"
        alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">

      <p>Also, please forgive that the highlighting does not perfectly line up with the birds on the screen. I believe
        part of this is because I’m only running a (relatively small) RN50 model with only 360P video quality. I believe
        that increasing either the video quality, or the CLIP model size would produce more refined visualizations,
        however, I only have a macbook pro laptop to work with, and I wanted to keep these results to relatively real
        time for application to live streaming. </p>

      <p>The specific loss function is shown here:</p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="python">def text_label_loss(self, output: torch.Tensor):
    inputs = self.tokenizer(texts=["birds"]).to(self.device)
    text_outputs = self.clip_model.encode_text(inputs)
    target_class_id = 0
    text_embedding = text_outputs[target_class_id]
    result = torch.cosine_similarity(output.squeeze(0), text_embedding, dim=0)
    return result
  </code></pre>
      </div>



      <p>In plain english: I compute the embedding value of the frame, compute the embedding value for the term “birds”,
        and use a cosine similarity between them and use that as the loss function. </p>

      <p>This shows that the Grad Cam technique can be applied to a CLIP model if provided with a specific text filter.
      </p>

      <p>While this is cool, a similar result may be obtained with a more traditional masking model. However, masking
        models require specific training data and known classes. Because I’m using a CLIP model, I can create any
        arbitrary text filter.</p>

      <h3>Defining a Loss Function: Abstract Text Labels</h3>

      <p>My goal is to interrogate the model and determine “what pixels are most semantically meaningful”, or what
        pixels have the most importance to the resulting embedding, and are relevant in the scene. So I can create a
        text label of something more abstract like "something noteworthy", and highlight all elements in the frame that
        are similar to "something noteworthy". </p>

      <p>I can ask the model what pixels are most similar to the label "an empty scene". But this is the exact opposite
        of what I ultimately want, so I can instead produce a negative loss function for this label. This is effectively
        asking “what pixels discourage labeling the image as ‘an empty scene’”. More concretely, “what pixels are NOT
        considered ‘an empty scene’”</p>

      <p>Here is the positive and negative loss functions side by side:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="python">
def text_label_loss(self, output: torch.Tensor):
    inputs = self.tokenizer(texts=["something noteworthy"]).to(self.device)
    text_outputs = self.clip_model.encode_text(inputs)
    target_class_id = 3
    text_embedding = text_outputs[target_class_id]
    result = torch.cosine_similarity(output.squeeze(0), text_embedding, dim=0)
    return result
  </code></pre>
      </div>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="python">
def text_label_loss(self, output: torch.Tensor):
    inputs = self.tokenizer(texts=["an empty scene"]).to(self.device)
    text_outputs = self.clip_model.encode_text(inputs)
    target_class_id = 3
    text_embedding = text_outputs[target_class_id]
    result = -torch.cosine_similarity(output.squeeze(0), text_embedding, dim=0)
    return result
  </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>Notice the 2nd to last results = … line is different between the two. </p>

      <p>Here are some examples and the labels used, along with the positive or negative loss result. </p>

      <div class="image-gallery" style="width: 1300px; margin: 0 -250px;">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_text_something_noteworthy_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">“something noteworthy” (positive loss)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_text_empty_scene_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">“an empty scene” (negative loss)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_text_background_clutter_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">“background clutter” (negative loss)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <p>While these results are reasonable, it’s not clear what is the best label to use. Additionally, each frame is
        considered in isolation, with no context or reference from prior frames. It would be best if we could use prior
        frames to help contextualize the understanding of the current frame. Further, this can only be applied to CLIP
        models which also map text to the same space as images. However, there are many high quality image embedding
        models which only operate on images, so these text filter loss functions will not work.</p>

      <h3>Defining a Loss Function: Compared to Prior Average</h3>

      <p>To leverage prior frames, there are two main techniques I considered. In both cases, I computed an average
        embedding vector of the prior N frames. For one loss function, I compared this average embedding to the specific
        embedding of the current frame, and for the other loss function I computed the delta between the average and
        current embeddings. </p>

      <h2>Similarity to Average</h2>
      <p>The loss function for the first case (comparing the current frame’s embedding to the average embedding) is
        shown below. </p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="python">
def recent_average_loss(self, output: torch.Tensor):
    result = -torch.cosine_similarity(
                 output.squeeze(0),
                 self.recent_image_embeddings.average_as_tensor(),
                 dim=0)
    return result
  </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>I ran 3 different experiments, each with an increasing window of frames used to compute the average:</p>

      <div class="image-gallery" style="width: 1300px; margin: 0 -250px;">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_10_recent_average_loss_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">10 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_100_recent_average_loss_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">100 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_500_recent_average_loss_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">

          <figcaption class="caption">500 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <p>Intuitively, the above loss functions can be understood as asking the model “What regions of the current frame
        are most semantically different to the prior 0.3, 3 or 15 seconds of video?”</p>

      <h2>Delta to Average</h2>
      <p>The second loss function used the delta between the average and the current frame. In order for this to work
        properly, I needed to normalize this delta.</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="python">
def recent_average_delta_loss(self, output: torch.Tensor):
    delta = self.recent_image_embeddings.average_as_tensor() - output
    result = delta.norm()
    return result
   </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>Again, the same window was used to produce 3 different results</p>

      <div class="image-gallery" style="width: 1300px; margin: 0 -250px;">
        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_10_recent_delta_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">10 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">
          <img src="../../img/lit_review/AEYE/_tokyo_100_recent_delta_animated.gif"
            alt="A few scenes of Tokyo at night, wight various parts of the frames highlighted in red">
          <figcaption class="caption">100 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="item">

          <figcaption class="caption">500 prior frames:</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <p>With this second style of loss function, we are asking the model “what regions of the image are driving the
        most semantic difference compared to the prior 0.3, 3 or 15 seconds of video?”</p>
